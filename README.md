# Sock

Simple multi-thread websocket echo server in Rust.

My goal was to learn [how to make
websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers)
from TcpListeners and how to use [MIO](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio) as
non-blocking I/O event manager.

This way I can use what I learn here to make
[Bite](https://github.com/alvivar/bite) compatible with the web.
